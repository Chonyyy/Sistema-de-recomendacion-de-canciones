nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a 47 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a

piggy bank for you so you could go to college almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back on to chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara and that's when daddy went to california with his cd and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me then you started seein' daddy on the tv and momma didn't like it and you and lainie were too young to understand it papa was a rolling stone momma developed a habit and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud now i'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin' lookin' at your baby pictures it just trips me out to see

who never blows his composure even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders i ain't never supposed to show it my crew ain't supposed to know it even if it means goin' toetotoe with

exhausted and i'm so caught in it that i almost feel i'm the one who caused it this ain't what i'm in hiphop for that's not why i got in it that was never my object for someone to get killed why would

it he wasn't gonna go after him until ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him fuck it 50 smash him mash on him let him have it meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record but now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways i came up was through that publication the same one that made me famous now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin' well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then but i'm so busy bein' pissed off i don't stop to think that we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc and he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind but we still have soldiers that's on the front line who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders never to extort us strictly to show they support us and maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a  to show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is but i ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered it ain't worth it i can't think of a perfecter way to word it than to just say that i love y'all too much to see the verdict i'll walk away from it all 'fore i let it go any further but don't get it twisted it's not a plea that i'm coppin' i'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin' off at the jaws well then i can 'cause frankly i'm sick of talkin' i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause   step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers bit by bit torn apart we never win but

close it's coming to fuck am i gonna do it's too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know   eminem sometimes i feel like all i ever do is find different ways to word the same old song ever since i came along from the day the song called hi my name is dropped started thinking my name was fault cause any time things went wrong i was the one who they would blame it on the media made me the equivalent of a modernday genghis khan tried to argue it was only entertainment dog gangster nah courageous balls had to change my style they said i'm way too soft and i sound like az and nas out came the claws and the fangs been out since then but up until the instant that i went against it it was ingrained in me that i wouldn't amount to a shit stain i thought no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught do i really belong in this game i pondered i just wanna play my part should i make waves or not so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on and i don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form i was raised upon but sometimes you gotta take a loss and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off and keep plugging it's your only outlet and your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah feel like i've already said this a kabillion 80 times how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme what i really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid to  pre sia eminem i was a afraid to make a single sound afraid i would never find a way out out out afraid i'd never be found my dreams i didn't wanna go another round yeah an angry man's

start over this is the only thing i thing i know   eminem i know what it was like i was there once single parents hate your appearance as you struggle to find your place in this world and the pain spawns all the anger on but it wasn't 'til i put the pain in song learned who to aim it on that i made a spark started to spit harder shit learned how to harness it while the reins were off and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck haters started to appreciate my art and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i caused but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone and the lights go out in that trailer park oh and the window is closing and there's nowhere else that i can go with flows and i'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song but i'd rather make not afraid  than make another motherfucking we made you ah now i don't wanna seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs my demise and my uprise pray to god i just open enough eyes later on and gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make you strong enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt cause i can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt just having to balance my dang self when on eggshells i was made to walk but thank you ma cause that gave me the strength to cause shadymania so when they empty that stadium least i made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done so this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted i represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that i made this song and everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more from this day forward just let them aholes talk take it with a grain of saltand eat their fucking faces off the legend of the angry blond lives on through you when im gone and to think i was a  pre sia eminem i was a afraid to make a single sound afraid i would never find a way out out out afraid i'd never be found my dreams i didn't

was my fault and i'll get sued see what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols and they wanna get one cause they think the shit's cool not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves we entertainers of course the shit's affectin' our sales you ignoramus but music is reflection of self we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail it's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin' to bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine haha who post pinup pictures on they walls all day long idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives so they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die 'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe we're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes that's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it squeeze it

just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you we'd be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep tellin' myself keep doin' like you're doin' no matter how many lives you ruin it's for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no one's ever indicted you why 'cause you're a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar   black boy

at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we 'bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities that's what we call 'em pigsties for they're like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky 'cause this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy

i'm a big rockstar  pt ii   seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life can't escape this circumstance i'd rather hear 'em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now it's better disguised banter but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers we're applying but mcdonald's seems to be the only franchise that'll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder that's why it's at a stalemate and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods 'cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneight'd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every day's another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my it's more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator don't gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers 'cause no one oversees these cops and all we see is 'em beat charges we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings just keep marchin' 'til we reach congress but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you don't stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or you'll be made to feel like a traitor we'll treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the brave is

find the page i was writing this rhyme on oh it's on the rampage couldn't see what i wrote i write small it says ever since i drove a '79 lincoln with whitewalls had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard so as long as i'm on the clock punching this time card hiphop ain't dying on my watch   now sometimes when i'm sleepin' she comes to me in my dreams is she taken is she

department with a pile in my cart rippin' the aisle apart but with great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content completely despondent and condescending the king of nonsense and controversy is on a beatkilling spree your honor i must plead guilty 'cause i sparked a revolution rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level boost it but several rebuked it and whoever produced it hiphop is the devil's music does that mean it belongs to me 'cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns that don't honk but every time i speak you hear a beep but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper rappers better stay clear of me bitch 'cause it's the   it's the time of the season when hate runs high and this time i won't

standing at the summit and plummet how come it wasn't what i thought it was was it too good to be true have nothin' get it all but too much of it then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens cause if not where the hell did it go cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin even if it means i'm sellin' my soul just to be the undisputed again do whatever i gotta do just to win cause i got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head crown around it thorns on it cracks in it bet you morons didn't think i'd be back did ya how 'bout that im somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that i bark this sport is somethin' i never bowout at i complain about the game i shout and i pout it's a lovehate but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt even when you bitches are countin' me out and i appear to be down for the count only time i ever been out and about is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but i'm not a quitter gotta get up give it all i got or give up spit on shit on stepped on but kept goin' i'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong

never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer wouldn't even take shit into consideration obliterate anyone in the way i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me but it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blowout to get me to retire tell these new artists that kings never die i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page did it just say i've been upstaged why am i online it's driving me crazy i'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge on what's hot but i'm not one to conform but as days pass in this shit and opinions sway i can hear 'em say if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous comeback as if i went away but detractors just say so much for the renegade someone's gonna make me blow my composure here i go again center stage and i feel like i'm in a cage they so want a champion to fall it's no wonder why i laugh at 'em cause why can't we win 'em all so fuck what these cynics say it just goes to show that when my back's against the wall and i'm under attack again that i'll act as if i'm 'posed ta with this pentup rage cause all these plaques in my office on the floor stacked against the door are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again cause all the accomplishments accolades awards and trophies just don't mean jack anymore if i'm here today and gone tomorrow and i'm not gonna be   gwen stefani here to stay even when i'm gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die   eminem i want it i'm comin' to get it so

leaving stop for no one i don't know but i've been told an obstacle that blocks your road ya knock it over time to go for the pot of gold cause   eminem they say kings never die just ask jam master

baggage need a luggage rack but we carry on with our public spats and our feuds up back in the news love taps when i dissed you like it was fun actually used to run back to the booth jump back in the studio give you a tonguelashing then you laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone it was funny back in our youth but then it wasnt after we knew that we were done and actually through and actually through but if there's one fraction of truth if it could be spun back i would do so many things different things different 'cause it was such a dumbass excuse you hit me once and that i would use to continue the pattern of abuse why did i punch back girls your dad is a scumbag im confused because   x ambassadors how come you can be a lord and a loser how come how come you can be a liar and

a little cried a lot i'll never forget when you came home and you held hailie day before you went to jail and daily how we'd wait for that mail lady or by the phone for mom to call and i watched you pull yourself up and we decided on givin' it one more try despite it all you're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark i'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box when we tied the knot when we broke the knot every line we crossed we were supposed to not every time we fought the insults they got thrown too far words that we said that we didnt mean the words that we meant that we didnt say the ones that we thought that we shoulda said letters written that we coulda read which maybe woulda led to some good instead and had this put to bed but i'd be lyin still if i said i wasn't sittin' here

harder than sawing off a fuckin' body limb once upon a time we're all we had maybe that's what drew us to each other it was true love shit we never knew was possible we might have loved each other too much and maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other all the screwups 'cause you always thought that you was more in love with me and i was thinkin' i was more in love than you was for all the times that we thought it worked 'til we saw how wrong we were when the dust settles now and all the dirt if i touch the rawest nerve all i want is for us not to hurt and it's been an exhaustive search to find the words but i just heard mockingbird and got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts the purpose was not to stir up or open wounds i've caused a few and so have you or argue whose fault it was partly yours partly mine but really no one's this is so tough i'm gettin' choked up oh fuck it we both suck we broke up got back together we both thought we had forever not bad people just bad together we were so nuts backstabbed each other another blow struck but there's no duckin' this blow 'cause it's over and it's closure but i'm not so sure how to close this i just don't know

and girls fuck you today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob huh say hi bob hi bob bob's thirty and still lives with his mom and he don't got a job 'cause bob sits at home and smokes pot but his twelveyearold brother looks up to him an awful lot and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks ahh and even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge 'til one night mrs stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker crazier than slim shady is off the vodka you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a doctor he grabbed stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her but ever since the day stacey went off to wander they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you so see if the squirrels want itit's bad for you   see children drugs are bad come on and if you don't believe me ask your dad ask him man and if you don't believe him ask your mom that's right she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will so kids say no to drugs that's right so you don't act like everyone else does uhhuh and there's really nothin' else to say sing along drugs are just bad mmkay   my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it fuck no you ain't seen it it's the size of a peanut huh speakin' of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels ecstasyit's the worst drug in the world if someone ever offers it to you don't do it kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid and spinal fluid is final you won't get it back so don't get attached or it'll attack every bone in your back meet zach twentyone years old after hangin' out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys and the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb his back starts to look like the mcdonald's arches he's on donald's carpet layin' horizontal barfin' bleh and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 'cause they took it too so they think it's funny so they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting their money meanwhile zach's in a coma the action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga and that's the story of zach the ecstasy maniac so don't even feed that to squirrels class 'cause it's bad for you   see children drugs are

and od they're gonna come for me and i'ma have to grow a goatee and get a disguise and hide 'cause it'll be my fault so don't do drugs and do exactly as i don't 'cause i'm bad for you   see children

little pussy's puny neck it's my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence but he just displays complete lack of respect that's what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me as he sits with both his feet up at his desk smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things and he just can't see that he's manically depressed and in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy as he turns on mtv and sees my face he don't exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into a rage and it's destroyin' him slowly 'cause he does not even know me even though he sees me everywhere he goes so he just tortures himself he has no fortune and wealth so he extorts someone else to get his dough and now he's actin' like a bully so he tries to push and pull me but he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad and he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me 'cause it annoys him to see that i ain't scared   you ain't no motherfuckin' bully and i ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully i won't allow it ain't gon' cower to no bully i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a bully fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully and i know it must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally   now i'm not tryin' to make no more enemies no more unfortunately there's so many other motherfuckers there just are they just keep houndin' at me now that i'm down with 50 suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja hahahaha but his ass is such a puppet irv could shove his whole hand up it and just make him say what he wants him to say but suge has irv on a string and irv's so nervous that he says anything to this man to keep him at bay so now ja thinks that he's so tough and murder inc's the big bad wolf and they go huff and puff and blow our label down but our building's made out of bricks so you ain't takin' out shit and dawg you just did a song with bobby brown so now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard 'cause you know we don't play that black and white shit plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch   you ain't no motherfuckin' bully and i ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully i won't allow it ain't gon' cower to no bully i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a bully fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully you must be takin' too much e   now what bothers me the most about hiphop is we're so close to pickin' up where we left off with big and pac we just lost jam master j big l got blasted away plus we lost bugz slang ton and freaky tah it's like a neverending cycle that just seems to come full circle everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard and i'm not excludin' myself 'cause i been stupid as well i been known to lose it when someone says something smart but as we grow as men we learn to let shit go but then again there's only so much bullshit we can really stand we all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes it's no exception it goes for every man but if irv really gave a fuck about ja like he claims he does he'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs but he just keeps feedin' him pills so if that e doesn't kill him someone from gunit will and i ain't buzzed dawg i'm talkin' to you straight if the situation escalates any worse we're gonna lose another soldier to this game and if i get killed for this rap i got a million in cash that says i will get you back in hailie's name   you ain't no motherfuckin' bully and i ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully i won't allow it ain't gon' cower to no bully i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a bully fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully irvine get your boy off of that e   get at me dawg holla"},

the immortal words of ll cool j as he would say i'm a goat and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes   this is the part i was worried about everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes and i'm in some dusty garage inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes and everyone's tellin' me what i should do and how i should come out and what to rap about and i know i got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that i gotta get out and i'm not sure how this is gonna come off they're probably gonna think that i'm comin' off as cocky like i just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me see the thing about me is you don't really know a thing about me everyone's makin' a stink about me like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me surround me with nothin' but gangsters killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals and i feel like i'm more comfortable around them than i do my own motherfuckin' neighbors but see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave but why does it seem like i'm not even put up in the same category as other mc's so when weezy says that he's better than jay z please be that just subliminally means he thinks jigga's the best and that he's the only one up in that league see and it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is knowin' goddamn well that i'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived period  hook i'm a goat and i don't mean to gloat but i know what i know and i know what you think and these magazines'll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes   maybe they figure that i'm on my way out the game so they gotta go try to find 'em a new eminem or a new shady if they think it's gonna happen man i thought i was crazy or maybe i could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that paul wall's white cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone see he's just aight and bubba sparxxx he just won't write because he's so caught up in that snow white that timbaland can't even get him in the studio he's so gone off that coke right and it's so sad cause he's dope right america's next great white hope right so now they feel like they gotta come up with some cornyass white rapper show right and which i'm still havin' mixed feelings about they said it'd be real i'm just spillin' it out there's somethin' about a white boy talkin' black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth and i love when the say that tiger woods shit isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black and i'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until 8 mile had came out but i had already hit middle america parents had all got to likin' me now when suddenly i wasn't such a bad guy all of the hatred for me must've died thought i committed career suicide so i had to turn back into the bad guy so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays anatomy god made raggedy ann and andy not raggedy andy and andy and andy and angelina jolie is just another ho and brad is a sucka because once i fuck her she wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby you know what i say  no you better save some of them kids from madonna she needs all the publicity she can get you wanted shady well you got it man i ain't apologizin' for shit  hook i'm a goat and i don't mean to gloat but i know what i know and i know what you think and these magazines'll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and i consider myself one of those so thank you very much here it goes   man i'm takin' my ball and goin' home man shit is too easy nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause i'm a goat so don't worry i'm out the motherfuckin' game and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best but y'all know that i'm a goat and like i said i'm one of the motherfuckin' best before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch but before i go i'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start and thank you very much to everybody who was and y'all ain't gotta say it just think it cause i know that you know that i know that you know that i know that i'm a goat i'm out

foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride  verse eminem well foolish pride has a lot of things to say you got foolish pride like you got tooth decay but tooth decay is another problem so let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it now when i talk about foolish pride i mean blacks and whites taking different sides when blacks and whites take different sides unity never happens and we will subside we will subside and hatred will release and everything will just crush that peace but when we crush that peace you see we start hatin' each other but remember you are my brother and you are my sister just like i'm a mister i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her i kissed her i placed it on her cheek and she didn't come back 'til next week now it was next week and she was back again wanting to kiss a white kid so she was my girlfriend we started going out but that's okay because we were black and white blacks and whites sometimes mix but black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks so i'ma say like this don't date a black girl take it as a diss if you want but if you don't i'ma tell you like this i surely won't never date a black girl because blacks only want your money and that shit ain't funny so i'ma say look honey why do you do this you know you step up to me like you a brutus then you try to grab my spinach because it's green and that's cash so get outta here 'cause i don't need your ass i said that before but that's okay because like i said you're a whore black girls and white girls just don't mix because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks white girls are good i like white girls i like white girls all over the world white girls are fine and they blow my mind and that's why i'm here now telling you this rhyme 'cause black girls i really don't like we don't mix it's like riding a bike when you're peddling hard uphill both ways you know it's kinda hard and that's why i say to you i'm giving you a little advice don't date a black girl if you do it once you won't do it twice you won't ever do it again because they'll take your money and that ain't funny so i'ma say look honey i've already said that before but like i said again you're nothing but a big whore so when mike catch on the bass line that's okay 'cause we will not just waste time i'll get straight to the point black girls are bitches that's why i'ma tell you you better pull up your britches 'cause all that cash is making your ass drag from the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad i mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy and then you turn around and fuck another big black guy now that's pretty wrong but you're just ganking but that's okay because you need a god damn spanking from me the funky mm i'm busting rhymes and i'm swallowing phlegm i'm busting a freestyle just like this i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed but when howard gets pissed that's okay because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days so i'll just worry about that problem when i come to it i'll cross that  when i come to it 'cause i forgot the  but that's okay 'cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us so i'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl she turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl a wack girl because black girls ain't funny all they want is your goddamn money they take you for everything you've got and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand so i'ma kick it to you just like this how does the  go i forgot but that's okay 'cause i'ma tell you in stride i'ma say ole foolish pride   eminem ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh date a white girl 'cause they got the raw hide"}, "Revival (Interlude)": {"": 207, "Artist": "Eminem", "Title": "Revival (Interlude)", "Album": "Revival", "Year": 2017, "Date":

understand that i've been through pain if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain but you can't just stand there and try to judge it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much and it's such a pleasure every button that i touch i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but  hook i'm only entertainin' you my goal is to stimulate makin' you high and take you and i

what a pooh butt day is  4 mm now a pooh butt day is something everybody's had no particular depression neither mad or sad you couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is cause when your feeling like a pooh butt then you're feeling like shit they come up at a certain time they don't have a season but most of the time you feel like one for no particular reason they get a careless attitude the yucky sensations some people won't accept love in a poohy situation sittin' on the toilet for an hour or so marks on the butt from the seat or the bowl grab a toilet paper and the seat and just wipe when i realize i may have sat the in the seat too tight so i shrug and shake from a stuck position but removing myself was an impossible mission screaming to get out i couldn't take it any more when my mother arrived and knocked upon the door we pulled and pulled and i was removed from the seat i couldn't sit down for a whole damn week never again will i get caught in that rut so i can stay fresh instead of feeling like a pooh but  hook mm sometimes things just never go my way you know ii just feel like a pooh butt today sometimes things just never go my way you know ii just

let you know we're getting ready to shoot the monster video we got dates for rihanna and she's gonna come out to detroit and we can get it shot we've got some concepts together based on your conversations with rich lee and i think we're ready to go  so the basic concept is sort of like an inceptiontype of vibe the whole video sort of happens inside of your head and rihanna in the beginning is gonna act as your therapist and you answer into her office you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off we're not really sure and next thing you know you're travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career and there's various stops along the way we're gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments  i had to go home and get my straightjacket redoing this scene actually brings back no memories for me because i don't remember it dr dre would say i'm glad to see you got your coat back on the way things should be  the scene from the my name is video with you in the straightjacket and dre as your therapist in the psychiatrist's office therethe song which recieved an oscar for you yes lose yourself will also be included we're gonna go back and revisit the way i am with you jumping off the building falling through the sky with everything moving past you and then we're also gonna do the classic grammy scene with you and elton john performing stan  eminem does an impersonation of elton john performing stan at the 00 grammy performance i can't see it all even if i could it'll all be grey but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad  so all these things are going on in your head you're travelling through the elevator looking at it from a new perspective with you watching yourself and then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator you come out and you see this sort of caged beast and the beast is actually slim shady  slim shady's inside of this cage and you walk up and you don't really know what's going on and then you see it's actually yourself and slim shady's feeding you some notes and we can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them and the idea that you keep feeding slim shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it and the songs'll keep coming back out  so it's really kind of a trip it's very surreal less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and it's more of a story through this journey  so anyway call me back after you listen to this um i sent the treatment over read through it and get ready for some really long days later  i'm done it's a wrap uh i never want to perform in these clothes again way too small i'm try'na go like quadruple x next time so these clothes are a fucking wrap too peace out  and goodnight give it up for him folks thank you very much"}, "1999": {"": 360, "Artist": "Eminem", "Title":

hip hop this is not what this is em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days and it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop  we were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up it started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record the song sort of evolves it started one way it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song  and i felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction em was gonna go in vocally and then when i heard the vocals that was pretty exciting because it was not at all what i was expecting and just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it it's so well done and so smart and so funny it's just great in this song we ended up using a wired  and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed  it reminds me of old hip hop

you're dissed so bad every time sure he don't get a turn and he's starting to get mad but i'm just going to take the mic i'm not gonna give it to him because i am so damn hyped in the place to be

star is worthwhile every time i grab the mic i'm longer than i mile   i waste no time when i can't flip i caper i cut your butt up like g floyd like paper when i bust a rhyme i'm a stud that's what i

i'd like you to meet my friend bob huh say hi bob hi bob bob's 0 and still lives with his mom and he don't got a job 'cause bob sits at home and smokes pot but his twelveyearold brother looks up to him an awful lot and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks and even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge 'til one night mrs stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker crazier than slim shady is off the vodka you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a doctor he grabbed stace' by the legs as chopped it off her aah and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her but ever since the day stacey went off to wander they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you so see if the

attack every bone in your back meet zach twentyone years old after hangin' out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys c'mon and the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb his back starts to look like the mcdonald's arches he's on donald's carpet layin horizontal barfin' bleh and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him h hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 'cause they took it too so they think it's funny so they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting the money meanwhile zach's in a coma the action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin'

"Album": "", "Year": 2013, "Date": "2013-11-01", "Lyric": "are you feeling good about the album at this point um that's a tough question man for the most part yeah but i don't know if i ever feel totally great about a record when i put it out with every record that i put out someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when i listen to my own music i just hear flaws in it like i hear 'oh fuck i could have done this better or that better' and i'll work it to death obviously if i wasn't comfortable with it i wouldn't put it out but from the beginning ever since my career started i don't know if i've ever been totally like this is completely it  in this last crunch what have you been working on i guess you would say last minute jitters of fuck are the vocals loud enough can you hear what i'm saying on this part is the beat right are the vocals too loud' if i could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that i rapped over and put them out i would do that 'cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it  but you're not changing lyrics or anything like that it's just all mix and sound stuff it's just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part because when i decide to keep a song that's pretty much it like if it doesn't work i pretty much know right away right when i get it in the car and take it home  rolling stone's review of eminem's the marshall mathers lp   so why did you dye your hair blonde again um i'll say that one was manager paul rosenberg's idea in the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit i had thought about it and once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be he hit me with the idea and i was like yo you know i thought about that right and he was like well you know why not and i was like i don't know how it's gonna look i haven't had it in how many fucking years five six years i was like i'm so used to it being dark you know so i just tried it and i was like fuck it  did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording not really honestly because i already had most of the songs and i don't know if i'm gonna keep it like this or how long i'm gonna keep it but for right now it is what it is and i feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record  for recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff you recorded 00 songs or something or at least you had 00 beats so was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around i feel like right now i'm probably working harder than i've ever worked in my life and i've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during the eminem show which is a little hazy 'cause just so much shit was going on at that time just being so busy with the eminem show and doing the 8 mile movie and the soundtrack and the score to the movie this is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly  that's crazy once i had the direction that i wanted to go and you know calling it the marshall mathers lp  obviously i knew that there might be certain expectations like i wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that so i wanted to make sure that i had the right songs to be able to call it that so a lot of recording a lot of songs that people probably will never hear we hit a couple of road blocks there were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever and just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like fuck man i feel like it needs this or this to paint the whole picture  a lot of people maybe even you think the original is your best album it's probably my favorite i think some of them are my favorites for different reasons hate to even say that about my own record but i mean the first three records i think they may have captured a time period and then i think i pretty much probably have publicly said you know encore and relapse wasn't  it was just a different time  you've been hard on relapse but tyler the creator says that it's his favorite hiphop record in years he loves that record yeah he tells me that every time i see him i don't hate the record i want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs and you know i don't know if i necessarily found that balance yet because i was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like ha ha this is funny you know walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it because when i got sober it was like  i've said this before  but it just was like oh shit i can think straight again so i don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs writing songs that felt like something that brought some kind of emotion i ran accents into the ground i got stuck on that kind of serial killer crazy vibe and just kind of went with it  on recovery obviously the world came to you on that one how do you feel now about that record i feel like that record i finally got back to where i was at maybe during the eminem show like creatively and songwriting i guess i mean obviously recovery was the first time i had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp aside from working with dre it was like i always wanted to produce my own records because producing is fun to me too one of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had es on them it's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words because my own hooks i already know what i mean when i write them the way that i do music is like regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have i always want to try to go as hard lyrically as i can so regardless if the beat feels like wow maybe this could be played on the radio i'm not like maybe radio would play this so i'll just wing it like i always have looked at it like i want to approach every record from an mcs' aspect  so how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to the marshall mathers lp how did you decide to make your life miserable like that well here's what it is it's not necessarily a sequel  okay as much as it is a revisitation  like this is a different time period in my life so there's not gonna be like continuations of every song or anything like that to me it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia one of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that you know retro shit and try to make it current like bring it up to date  so did seeking out rick rubin come from that direction you were like why don't i go back to the source paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and i was like fuck man another thing with this record is that i kind of got back into producing more on recovery i wanted to focus more on writing and not have to worry abut making the beats on relapse i think it was mostly all dre so i kind of started producing again a little bit i was kind of in the middle of that when paul had mentioned that and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and i don't know if that's what made paul reach out to rick or if rick reached out to him but as soon as i heard he was interested i was like yo just let me finish this up and let's go see him  you've called rick yoda  was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career yoda voice learning i did um yeah i mean the best part about rick's vibe is he's very zenlike in the sense of just let it happen the weird thing about it is nine times out 0 we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right you know he's almost like a coach  he's very psychological right yeah the guy's got his shoes off laughs working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere he's not afraid to try anything i kind of felt in the same way i felt and still feel to this day as far as like wanting to impress dre we talked at his house and then i think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats i told him that i had started experimenting with some more retro sounds so we just sat down and started picking shit out and i would start writing to them and next time i'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it the dude's got so many ideas man one of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the rick rubin scratches when he fucking scratches some shit it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it not that it's offtime or anything like that but it's just like  it's fucking weird i don't even know how to explain it you just know that he scratched it i don't know if that even makes sense or not it's like a simple scratch like a basic kind of thing but it's so fucking dope when you hear it it's just it's vintage him and plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit  did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio oh he's got some shit in the stash yeah definitely  so much has changed in hiphop since you started producing  did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff um not necessarily because like i feel like i just do whatever feels right obviously i pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse but i don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing that's no offense to anyone else  basically if there are outside influences that are current you let that come in from the other producers but your shit is your shit yeah that's exactly it more currentsounding shit i leave to them and not that i don't feel like my shit sounds current but it's not the exact same thing and i think i've updated as well  on the new song legacy you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid what does it take to get back in that mindset at your age i always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said he ain't shit or bullied or whatever it felt like one of them selfempowerment songs everybody i believe wants to show the world that one day i'm gonna be this one day i'm gonna be that everybody has goals aspirations or whatever and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them like if you haven't been kicked or whatever if you never went through    tribulations tribulations and shit like that then you're perfect and fuck you anyways so everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted like you don't matter oh yeah i'm gonna show you so it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy  into what i leave behind when i'm gone and i always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me there's many many songs that got me through a lot of shit  i just love that you rhyme onyx with comics on that song i don't know if anyone will get this like this is supernerdy but the rhyming words in that song never change and that's just one of the things that i do to try to challenge myself i wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed  you've praised the beastie boys' evolution but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a the disrespect for women has got to be through moment i mean listen my sense of humor has certainly not gone away i realize that i'm an adult a grownass man and i don't know what i'll be doing a year from now 0 years from now but i don't think that my tongueincheekness will ever go away i guess it's just a part of my personality i always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well if one song is darker or talking about a sad subject i don't want to make a whole album of that of being a downer i don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity you gotta try and find that right balance and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting in other words recording till i get it and if i record 00 fucking songs and i don't have what i feel like i need yet to make the body of work then i'm gonna keep going and keep recording  you've written a bunch of your own hooks and even sing some of them where does your sense of melody come from that's a good question i would want to say that it's stemming from early hiphop rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies at least on the shit that i grew up on i don't know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is i can only hum something but i think it just comes from all the data that i've collected in my years of listening to music and you know fuck man i think that as hiphop started evolving there was more melody in it people were starting to sing hooks even like early slick rick  sings hey young world  those kind of things maybe i took it somewhere different at times i don't know  maybe it's just pure instinct honestly that's probably what it is i don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but i just don't know where i get that sense from you know what i'm saying i'm not a singer singer i just know what's in key and what's not  having kendrick lamar on your album did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you i completely respect what kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp that he's on aftermath only made sense to me he came to detroit we kicked it for a few minutes you know and i felt the vibe of what he's like and everything and you know he's a super cool and super humble dude when we did that record i think that was actually a week or two before he did the to control  is there advice you would give him at this point i don't know if he needs advice he seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders man he's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one he's like a hiphop head man he just loves hiphop and obviously the way that he did the control verse it was almost like if you get mad at him then you might look foolish he set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that shit he said because it was what every other mc is already thinking or you should be thinking  fundamentally do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog i think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour day by day with me that whole rap god record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek so i mean do i want to feel like that maybe sometimes again it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best again that's why kendrick's worked so well because he only said what every rapper's already thinking if you don't want to be the best then why are you rapping    read more httpwwwrollingstonecommusicnewseminemqaexclusivethemakingofthemarshallmatherslp00ixzz8t7kbh5l follow us rollingstone on twitter  rollingstone on facebook"}, "Whoo Kid

heel with the  i was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach and now that i'm famous it's really really difficult to do very simple things i think it's the hardest thing to give up but my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim never make excuses never expect anyone else to provide for me things i know i can provide for myself i have dreams and i feel like i have a power to actually make those dreams a reality when you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore you become the property of the public there's nothing real about it  just look at these dazzling women the finest representatives of our nation ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown  you can't put your finger on who i am i can't put my finger on who i am i am complicated i grew up with a lot of conflict and drama's and i've been through a lot just like everyone else my escape was always music and i'm so lucky that that's my job but if i accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with it would be worth nothing you know you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter you have to have something that is forever something that's invisible  i was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable and i always felt like it was my job to fix the problem people pleaser but i'm no longer afraid of conflict and i don't think conflict is a bad thing because i know that when you grow up when you learn a few things  you're no longer afraid of letting go you're no longer afraid of the unknown you're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable and it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say i like that person you know if i hadn't gone through you know some of the painful experiences in my life i would not be me and i feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary i watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective we do not value ourselves enough especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are i've always been very very specific and very choosy very choosy about what i do with my body and who i want to share that with people feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way there's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life i always considered myself a feminist although i was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it when honestly it's very simple it's just when you know a person that believes in equality for men and women men and women balance each other out and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other i have a lot of empathy for men and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created especially for africanamerican men i have the same empathy for women and the pressures we go through the woman has to provide so many things for their children i consider myself a humanist  you know everybody's not good at everything you know it's ok to depend on someone it's actually what we're supposed to do we're supposed to depend on each other and when you find the person that you trust and you love and you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you it is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life happiness comes from you no one else can make you happy you make you happy and one thing that's for sure the love i have for music for my husband for my child is something that will last far beyond my life"}, "Lost Yo Mind": {"": 159, "Artist": "Beyonc\u00e9", "Title":

achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect  humanity requires both men and women and we are equally important and need one another so why are we viewed as less than equal these old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning we have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect so that as they grow up gender equality becomes a natural way of life and we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible  we have a lot of work to do but we can get there if we work together women are more than 50 percent of the population and more

which was a really defining moment in my life as a child in my mind we would perform on star search we would win we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time there's no way in the world i would ever imagine losing as a possbility you know i was only 9 years old so at that time you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose it was the best message for me when i put ed macmahon ducing us as the hiphop rapping girls' tyme it clicked something in my mind i feel like something about the aggression of bow down and the attitude of flawless  the reality is sometimes you lose and you're never too good to lose you're never too big to lose you're never too smart to lose it happens and it happens when it needs to happen and you have to embrace those things    i was scrolling through videos about feminism on youtube and i ran across this video of this incredible nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie everything she said is exactly how i feel  my message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection i had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion and at the end of the day when you go through all of these things is it worth it i mean you get this trophy and you're like 'i basically starved i have neglected all of the people that i love i've conformed to what everybody else thinks i should be and i have this trophy what does that mean' the trophy represents all of the sacrafices i made as a kid all of the time that i lost being on the road in the studios as a child and i just wanna throw that shit up i have a lot of awards and i have a lot of these things that i'm amazing and i'm  i worked my ass of i worked harder then probably everybody i know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'mommy' no nothing feels like when i look at my husband in the eyes nothing feels like when i'm respected when i get on the

attention i'm not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice by 'focus on me' i literally mean focus on me focus on what i'm all about and what i believe in  the more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like what we're wearing our gender our hairstyle our sexuality the color of our skin but focus on each other on a soul level the more we realize how much we have in common the more we listen to each other the more one we become  the title of ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her too

judge because you focus on appearance on clothes you focus on what you want from me what you want from people how you want them to wear their hair you judge me you wanna see me dressed a certain way

wasnt my place to make any sort of announcement so i kept quiet until now i want to thank nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true for being a family to me for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career and for of course ducing me to many of my fans however many years ago i want to thank dan schneider for allowing me to play such a special beautiful character who i hid behind for so long what i mean by that is when i was younger people loved cat so much i used to pretend to be more like her it took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are i think thats honestly because i admire her so much her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work she always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good  i will always hold cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult i know she seems like a simple daft character and she is but she played such a huge part in my life i just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things i love most about her i think a lot of people could take a page out of her book she wouldnt judge anybody by their appearance she believed the best in people she wasnt afraid of anything or anybody she never let peoples judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted acting how she wanted dressing how she wanted wanted dying her hair however she wanted she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real which is something i personally do all the time but i wish i could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does  one of my favorite things about cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder as we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across we hold back a little more protect ourselves a little more and although cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up she never changed or lost her childlike wonder to me thats the bravest most special thing about her she actually reminds me a lot of frankie in that way  so i know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some dumb kids show character     but to me she is actually a lot smarter stronger and braver than all the rest of us  hopefully well find out one day if cat  robbie ever got married if i had any say in the story from here on out id make sure they were happily married with sweet eccentric jewish artificially red headed babies cat would constantly find herself reminding aunt sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house theyd live down the street from jade and beck also happily married with purple and black haired pale grungy beautiful goth babies   thank you to the cast and crew who i spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years thanks for lighting us beautifully shooting us beautifully making the most incredible props yelling at us when we were running late to set keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment the guys behind the scenes couldnt have been more pleasant or hard working and i appreciate them for that so much i cant imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in hollywood  thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine dan schneider i will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted  lastly thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started you are the most loyal dedicated and continuously loving supporters i could ever imagine weve been through so much and you are still here and weve got a long way to go  thank you for believing in me accepting me and loving me i love you forever", "Year": 2014}, "Bang Bang (3LAU Remix)": {"Artist": "Ariana Grande",

woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated  celebrated aww shiiit he smashed  i know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating  married to  attached to having sex with or not  seen with but by their value as an individual  i want the people reading this to know that they are more than enough on their own i want the media to please help me with this please support each other i'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like i constantly had to have a boy by my side after being on my own now for a few months i am realizing that that's just not the case i have never felt more present grounded and satisfied i've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more  one more thought my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as i can with my fans that is something i have done since day one and never plan on changing it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny special personal things
